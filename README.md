# Tower of Hanoi

Tower of Hanoi is a Mathematical Game or Puzzle, where there are three rods namely Origin rod `O`, Destination rod `D` and and Intermediate rod `I`.  
Disks of variable size, arranged in Descending order, are placed in the rod `O` and our job is to transfer all of them to the rod `D`.  
But we have to follow certain rules  
- Only one disk can be moved at a time.  
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.  
- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
